# ESG Dashboard for Agricultural SMEs

This Streamlit app visualizes sustainability metrics for small and mid-sized farms.

## Executive Summary

This ESG Dashboard is a visual-first tool designed to help agricultural SMEs monitor and improve their sustainability performance. Built using Streamlit and powered by realistic UK farming data, the dashboard tracks key environmental, social, and governance metrics from 2021 to 2025. It includes carbon emissions, water usage, waste generation, labor intensity, fertilizer application, energy consumption, and biodiversity scores.

The dashboard presents trends through interactive line charts, bar charts, and a radar chart that highlights the 2025 ESG profile. These visuals make it easy for stakeholders to identify progress, spot areas for improvement, and align with regulatory or investor expectations. The tool is lightweight, scalable, and tailored to the needs of small and mid-sized farms that often lack access to enterprise-level ESG reporting systems.

By combining credible data with intuitive design, this MVP supports endorsement applications, pilot outreach, and investor engagement. It lays the foundation for a broader ESG platform that can scale across the UK agricultural sector and beyond.
